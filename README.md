# Midi Player

A student project I made at Faculty of Science, University of Novi Sad. It is an extension of Teaching Assistant's very short example of how to make a midi player using Java in class. I added more notes, tempo, note lenghts, and a special notation and parser for reading and writing the midi files. I also transcribed the song Megalovania from Undertale in this format to server as an example.
